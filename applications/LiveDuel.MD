Overview

Please provide the following:

    LiveDuel is an interactive media and gaming company targetting the sports and esports industry.
    
    Fan engagement has moved almost entirely digital, which opens up huge opportunities for innovative solutions. 
    
    LiveDuel is building next generation fan engagement through interactive steaming where users play an active part in the live action. 
    
    Live action is what sports and esports is all about, as passionate sports fans we know that there is a better way for fans to be a part of the action. 
    
    Whether that is through active participation in live quizzes, fantasy and prediction games or through live on demand features like stats and chat. 
    
    The future of sports is live, the future is LiveDuel 
    
    Choose to Win! 
    
    Bepro-js offers a wide range of innovative solutions that we are excited to integrate. From gaming, prediction markets and NFT's.

    We see a future where all of these exist in one ecosystem powered by LiveDuel. 
    
    We are passionate sports fans and understand what fans want and need to feel closer to the action from around the world. We want to build a fan centric product that delivers great     value to the fans as well as teams, leagues and sponsors. 

Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

    Mockups/designs of any UI components
    Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
    An overview of the technology stack to be used
    Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
    PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
    What your project is not or will not provide or implement
        This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
        
    LiveDuel will build a series of interactive components that form part of the web application using React. This will allow us to reuse these components in a way that will allow them     to be used in others settings. For instance we strongly believe in live streaming, so these componets can be used in interactive overlays that can run on top of streams to engage       users in a meaningful way. 
    
    Our MVP will be a prediciton market for sports and esports games and competitions. 

Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

    Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
    What need(s) does your project meet?
    Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem?
        If so, how is your project different?
        If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
        
    LiveDuel's target sports fans, clubs and leagues. 
    
    LiveDuel will offer next generation fan engagement tools to sports teams and leagues looking to the blockchain as part of their digital transformation. 
    
    Our audience is sports fans but we will look to rights holders in the form of clubs and leagues who have problems that they are looking to solve via digital means. 
    
    Our target customer needs to engage fans in a more meaningful way via digital channels in order to own the fan relationship in the digital world. With sports being more global than     its ever been, our customers need tools to help them reach and engage their fans in a meaningful way. 
    
    Our project is unique in many ways but it has a number of similarities to PolkaMarkets, Real Fevr etc.
    
    LiveDuel is differnt from the above mentioned companies as we take a different approach to our distribution and monetization strategy. While we have elements of a prediciton market     and NFT's our implementation will be quite different.

Development Status üìñ

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

    academic publications relevant to the problem,
    links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
    references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the bepro network core team,
    previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

Development Roadmap üî©

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to BEPRO Network. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.

For each milestone,

    make sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here.
    include the amount of funding requested per milestone.
    include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
    provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
    commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
    indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
    Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

    ‚ö° If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

Overview

    Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
